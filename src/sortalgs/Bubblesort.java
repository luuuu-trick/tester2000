 * Please implement Bubblesort in this file
 * explanation: Bubblesort takes the first element of the array and compares it to the next. If the held element is          
 * bigger than the next it swaps them. If not Bubblesort takes the next element as the held element.
 * This way bubblesort creates a sorted part of the array at the end of it.
